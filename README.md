As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

1. bike ---> working? ---> true / false
2. if 1 is true, docking station ---> release bike

Additional requirements in User Story: 

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.
